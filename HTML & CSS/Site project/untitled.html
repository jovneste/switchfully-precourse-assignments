              <p>Strength Training as its name implies is the pursuit of getting stronger(and bigger) through exercise. It has been gaining popularity because of the emergence of sports like strongman, in which contestants participate in feats of strength against each other and powerlifting, in which people perform 3 exercises (squat,bench and deadlift) and the person with the highest weight total wins.
                Strength training also has a lot of health benefits, studies have shown that frequent strength training correlated with a longer life span, stronger bones, lower chance of osteoporosis and improved brain function.

              </hgroup>
              <p>
                I like strength training because it gives me a clear goal to strife towards(for example a 200 kg squat) and it gives me a huge confidence boost once I hit that goal.
                I also like to mention that strength training isn't bodybuilding, the goal isn't to eventually starve yourself so you can have a low bodyfat fat percentage to hop on stage, but to just simply get stronger(though I might sometimes lose weight a bit to prevent getting too fat). 
                In the future I would also like to compete in strongman or powerlifting, although I'm currently way too weak for that.
