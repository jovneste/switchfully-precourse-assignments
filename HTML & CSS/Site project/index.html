              <p>Hello!, I'm an (ex-)student informatics who was lucky enough to get selected for the switchfully java course.
                I am from Wingene, a rural municipality in West-Flanders with its only claim to fame being that there are more pigs than people residing there AKA not the most 
                exciting place in the world. I'm looking forward to working and learning with you all. Word of warning, I have been told that I quote Lord of the Rings a bit too much (according to some).

              <p>In my spare time I like to go to the gym, play cardgames,  play videogames mostly rpg's, platformers and 'boomer' shooters.
                I also recently began reading again, I'm currently going through tolkien's work.
